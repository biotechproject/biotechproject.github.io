# Bioremediation
## What is Bioremediation?
Bioremediation is the use of living organism to absorb nutrients and restore an environment to its original condition.

## Notable companies, people, and events in bioremediation
* [TED Talks](https://www.ted.com/talks)
* George M. Robinson invented modern bioremediation in the 1960s.
Scientists used George M. Robinsons discovery to try and clean out fuel tanks on the RMS Queen Mary. The attempt was successful and ever since 1972, humans have been using and improving these microbes.
* Bioremediation has existed since around 600 BC, although invented in the 1960s. It is believed that the Romans used microorganisms to treat their waste water just like bioremediation today.
* Michigan's Copper County: A closed copper mine left highly contaminated soil behind and Li & Wusirika added bacteria from a local lake used a mine dump to decontaminate the soil and promote plant growth.
* Bacteria indigenous to a landfill in Medellin, Colombia were used in bioremediation. The scientist Gomez explored the process of bioaugmentation to speed it up.

## Advantages and disadvantages of bioremediation

| Advantages                           | Disadvantages                      |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Takes advantage of natural processes | Less effective                     |
| Cost effective                       | Slower than other methods          |
| Environmentally friendly             | Only works during specific seasons |
| Doesn't involve noisy equipment      |                                    |
| Aesthetically pleasing               |                                    |

## Classification of bioremediation
<dl>
<dt>In-situ</dt>
<dd>The process of soils/groundwater utilizing indigenous naturally occurring microorganisms to degrade contaminants</dd>
</dl>

| Advantages                                             | Disadvantages                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Small area for equipment                               | Less suitable in soils with low permeability |
| Ideal for sites with a small footprint                 |                                              |
| Can address many different contaminants simultaneously |                                              |
| Non-intrusive to above ground structures               |                                              |

<dl>
<dt>Ex-situ</dt>
<dd>A biological process in which excavated soil is placed in a lined above-ground treatment area and enhances the degradation of organic contaminants by the indigenous microbial population</dd>

| Advantages                                    | Disadvantages                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Suitable for a wide range of contaminants     | Not applicable to heavy metal contamination     |
| Simple to assess from site investigation data | Can require large areas for treatment beds      |
| Flexible with respect to volumes              | Dependent on temperature, weather, and material |
