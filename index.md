## Notable companies, people, and events in bioremediation
* [TED Talks](https://www.ted.com/talks)
* George M. Robinson invented modern bioremediation in the 1960s.
Scientists used George M. Robinsons discovery to try and clean out fuel tanks on the RMS Queen Mary. The attempt was successful and ever since 1972, humans have been using and improving these microbes.
* Bioremediation has existed since around 600 BC, although invented in the 1960s. It is believed that the Romans used microorganisms to treat their waste water just like bioremediation today.
* Michigan's Copper County: A closed copper mine left highly contaminated soil behind and Li & Wusirika added bacteria from a local lake used a mine dump to decontaminate the soil and promote plant growth.
* Bacteria indigenous to a landfill in Medellin, Colombia were used in bioremediation. The scientist Gomez explored the process of bioaugmentation to speed it up.
